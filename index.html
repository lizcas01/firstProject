    <h2>Coding Journey</h2>
    <p>In this section, I will be using one HTML element that I haven't learned <br> or heard about until I started takiing this class.
    
    <h3>&lt;Pre Element&gt;</h3>
    <pre>The element that was used to write this last section is called the &lt;pre&gt; element. <br>This makes it so it's shown exactly like it is in an HTML file to preserve space. </pre>
